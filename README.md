## Methods for Adding CSS

- Use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file
- Create separate 'style.css' as an external file. Properly link to the 'style.css' file in the HTML file
- The `div` element have CSS added via the external method
- The `p` element have CSS added via the internal method
- The `button` element have CSS added via the inline method

## Class and ID Selectors

- Odd numbered `p` elements share a class
- The even numbered `div` elements have unique IDs
- The Number 3 element have multiple classes

## Grouping Selectors

- Each element have a unique class name
- Use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share
- Make separate rules for the styles unique to each element

## Chaining Selectors

- Properly chain class selectors for each rule
- The `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions
- The `distorted` image end up looking squished and distorted

## Descendant Combinator

- The elements that contain the text "This should be styled" have the correct styles applied
- The elements that contain the text "This should be unstyled" have no styles applied
